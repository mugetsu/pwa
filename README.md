This is my first simple PWA which shows the time with [SMAZEE](http://smazee.com "SMAZEE") logo at center.

The advantage of PWA are :
- **Reliable** — Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.
- ** Fast** — Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
- ** Engaging** — Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.

Though it does not give Native app experience, but it can atleast serve required content to the user. The main advantage is that it can even load and run** offline**. PWA are build with simple and minimal UI which can load fast and gives the content correctly.Push Notification can be added to increase the user experience. Many site like Flipkart, AliExpress, Twitter are using PWA to increase the customers reviews.
